# E-Learni
- e-Learni is a medium for engaging learners in an online training course. e-Learni courses can exist in many forms, using different types of technologies. Commonly used in organizations and corporations, e-Learni can help learners complete training and education objectives with ease and flexibility as compared to traditional classroom-based learning.

- e-Learni courses can use a variety of content, including audio and video lectures, presentations, assessment, assignments, polls, surveys, reading materials, multiple choice question answers and more.

- A learning management system (LMS) is used to publish the e-Learni courses online. An LMS allows course instructors to streamline their e-Learni content allowing learners to access the course material in one easy-to-access location.

- A variety of studies have evaluated the impact of eLearning and concluded that— supported by holistic approaches that include appropriate policies, infrastructure, professional development, and curri- cula—eLearning can help produce positive outcomes. Research also seems to indicate that a more technology-rich environment delivers greater impacts.

# The Benefits of e-Learni

e-Learni helps make learning more accessible for learners around the globe. In education, it brings learning opportunities to previously disadvantaged groups. In business, it helps unite and train an increasingly global workforce. When learning materials are available online, learners can access their course material from anywhere and at any time using any device. A good quality LMS allows users to participate in e-Learni courses from desktop computers, smart phones, and tablets. This means that users can learn any time of day, whenever it’s most convenient for them—something classroom and face to face learning can’t compete with. Learners can also start a learning session on one device (say a smartphone while they are traveling) and continue the same course on another device (say a tablet or laptop at home in the evening), making it easier to fit learning into busy lives.
